### PhD candidate  
I'm in the fourth year of Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I received the B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in 2018. Now I'm working in [Sustainable Architectures and Infrastructure Laboratory (SAIL)](http://202.120.38.37/sail/index.html) in [Emerging Parallel Computing Center (EPCC)](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn). My supervisor is Minyi Guo and my coadvisor is Prof. Chao Li.

My Curriculum vitae is [CV](http://wangjing-home.github.io/CV.pdf).



### Research Area
My research interests is in the fields of Heterogeneous Architecture of computer System, especially Graph processing, FPGA accelerators, programming environment, hardware resources allocation, and so on.
